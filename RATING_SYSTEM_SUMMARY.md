# Dynamic Rating System - Simple Summary

## What Was Built

A smart rating system has been implemented that combines your expert opinion as an admin with feedback from your users. Previously, only the admin-provided rating was displayed on movies, and while users could submit reviews with ratings, those ratings weren't being used. Now, when you set a rating for a movie (like 8.5 out of 10), that becomes the starting point. As users watch movies and leave reviews with their own ratings, the system automatically calculates a "dynamic rating" that balances your expert baseline with the community's opinion. The clever part is that your admin rating always maintains influence - it starts at 100% when there are no reviews, gradually decreases as more users review the movie, but never drops below 30% influence even with hundreds of reviews. This ensures quality control while still respecting user feedback.

## How the Rating Algorithm Works

The system uses a "Hybrid with Decay" algorithm that intelligently weighs admin expertise against user consensus. Here's how it calculates the final rating: First, it determines how much influence the admin rating should have using this formula: **Admin Influence = max(0.3, 1 ÷ (1 + number of reviews ÷ 10))**. This means with zero reviews, admin influence is 100% (1.0). With 10 reviews, it drops to 50% (0.5). With 50+ reviews, it settles at the minimum of 30% (0.3). Then, the dynamic rating is calculated as: **Dynamic Rating = (Admin Influence × Admin Rating) + ((1 - Admin Influence) × User Average Rating)**. For example, if you rate a movie 8.5 and users give it an average of 7.0 across 10 reviews, the calculation would be: (0.5 × 8.5) + (0.5 × 7.0) = 4.25 + 3.5 = 7.75. This approach ensures that your expert opinion always carries weight while allowing popular opinion to gradually shape the rating as more users engage with the content.

## How It Works in Practice

The system works automatically in the background. When a user submits, edits, or deletes a review, the movie's rating instantly recalculates and updates everywhere on your site - the homepage, movie catalog, search results, and detail pages. Users can see exactly how the rating was calculated on each movie's detail page, showing your baseline rating, the number of user reviews, their average rating, and the final combined score. As an admin, you get a special dashboard at `/admin/ratings` where you can see analytics like which movies have the most reviews, where your ratings differ most from users' opinions, and a button to recalculate all ratings if needed. The ratings are also color-coded (green for excellent 8.0+, yellow for good 6.0-7.9, red for poor below 6.0) making it easy for visitors to quickly identify quality content at a glance.
